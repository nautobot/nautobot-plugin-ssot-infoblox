## Extensibility Attributes

Extensibility Attributes in Infoblox are a method of adding additional contextual information to objects in Infoblox. The closest analog in Nautobot is a Custom Field so this information has been imported as such. There is also an effort to attempt to match the information in these fields where possible to available objects in Nautobot. These available links are noted below:
